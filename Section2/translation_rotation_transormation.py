# Translation are geometric distortions enacted upon an image
# Are used to correct distortions or perspective issues from arising from the point of view an
# image was captured
# Two main type :
## Affine : scaling, rotation, translation, skewing (transforming)
## In affine translation, parallelism is conserved
## None Affine (Projective transform, Homography) : does not preserve parallelism, length and angle
# but conserves collinearity and incidence
